# Quaternary Calculator: Team 2
## Calculator Manual:
This is a calculator that performs calculations in the quaternary number system. Click the buttons corresponding to the numbers and operations you need. This calculator supports 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square and square root. In addition, the toggle button can be used to display the decimal equivalent of whatever quaternary 
number is currenty displayed. The clear button is used to clear what's on the display. This calculator does not offer support for negative numbers. If you end up with a negative
result, you will need to hit the clear button before performing any additional calculations.
